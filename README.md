**Spotify-Data-Exploration**

Using Spotify API and my personal streaming data, I have analyzed my daily and monthly Spotify usage behavior and my taste in music (e.g. my favorite genres, artists, and tracks). I used data vizualization packages such as plotly to create interactive charts that highlight some of the findings. 


●	I requested my streaming data from Spotify in json files, which includes data from March 2019 to March 2020. 

●	The data about artists and tracks were pulled from Spotify web API, called "spotipy" (<https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>).

●	I used Python packages including Pandas, Numpy, and Plotly in order to create data structures and bubble map
